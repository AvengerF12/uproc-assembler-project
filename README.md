# uproc-assembler-project

This project can be split into two components



    **Sheet Parser**

        Automatises the retrieval of some values from a spreadsheet in order to avoid the tedious task of copying them manually every time there is a change.
    
        Usage
    
            Give the spreadsheet file as the first argument and the file in which to redirect the output as the second argument.
            > Ex ./sheetParser spreadsheet.ods output.bin



    **Uproc Assembler**

        TODO.
